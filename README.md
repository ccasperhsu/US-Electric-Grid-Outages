## Introduction
One of the most important roles in the nation is to balance the instantaneous changes of electricity demand with steady supply. What makes this difficult is not only the uncertain load for data centers, but also outages caused by a mixture of natural, manmade events. This exploratory data analysis project aims to explore the official outage reporting data from the Department of Energy (DOE). The insights derived from this analysis can benefit not only the government authorities in charge, but also the end customers who may take proactive actions towards future outage events.

## Data
The OE-417 Form is used by the DOE to stay updated with current energy crises and can subsequently create policy and infrastructure changes to prevent future outages from occurring. Utilities must either file through the Balancing Authority, such as California Independent System Operator (CAISO), or file independently ([Who Must Submit](https://doe417.pnnl.gov/instructions#:~:text=considered%20electric%20utilities.%29-,Who%20Must%20Submit,-Balancing%20Authorities%20%28BA)). Power outage data based on the OE-417 form from 2021 to 2023 was manually downloaded and processed for the purpose of this analysis.
