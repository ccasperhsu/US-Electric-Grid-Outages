## Introduction
One of the most important roles in the nation is to balance the instantaneous changes of electricity demand with steady supply. What makes this difficult is not only the uncertain load for data centers, but also outages caused by a mixture of natural, manmade events. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) project aims to explore the official outage reporting data from the Department of Energy (DOE). The insights derived from this analysis can benefit not only the government authorities in charge, but also end customers who may take proactive actions towards future outage events.

### Background
*NERC was certified by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to act as the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) as designated in the Federal Power Act of 2005. NERC has delegated certain authority to its six Regional Entities to conduct activities such as proposing regional Reliability Standards, engaging in compliance monitoring and enforcement activities, and performing reliability assessments*

ERO (Electric Reliability Organization) Enterprise = NERC (North America Electric Reliability Corporation, the main coordinator in charge) + 6 RE (regional entities, not registered entities: MRO, NPCC, RF, SERC, Texas RE, WECC)

## Data
The OE-417 Form is used by the DOE to stay updated with current energy crises and can subsequently create policy and infrastructure changes to prevent future outages from occurring. Utilities must either file through the Balancing Authority, such as California Independent System Operator (CAISO), or file independently ([Who Must Submit](https://doe417.pnnl.gov/instructions#:~:text=considered%20electric%20utilities.%29-,Who%20Must%20Submit,-Balancing%20Authorities%20%28BA)). Power outage data based on the OE-417 form from 2021 to 2023 was manually downloaded and processed for the purpose of this analysis.
